Login and logout of the system
================================

Before you can use the SimpleOFAC Suiteâ„¢, you must login to the system first. 
The functions you have depend on the roles you have in the system. 
So you may see a different navigation menu in the left side when you login with different id.

Login to the system
----------------------

Open your favorite browser (IE, or Firefox or Chrome etc.) and type the following url in the address bar::

   http://www.simpleofac.com/cp102/index.html 
  (replace the www.simpleofac.com with your own domain name, cp102 with your own context name) 

You will see the login dialog, as follows:

Click the Log out link to log out of the system. 
If the user idles for 10 minutes, a warning dialog will pop up informing the user that the session will timeout within 5 minutes.

Click the Yes button to stay connected or the No button to log off right away. 
The system will log off after 5 minutes if no action is taken.
