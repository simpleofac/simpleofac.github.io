File Scan
============

File Scan allows the user to scan large volumes of data together. 
The format of the file can be csv or xml file. 
It has a build-in algorithm to check the unique of each record if the record itself does not have a unique Id. 
The scan result will be loaded into Watch List Alert database for review.

Click the **File Scan** in the left navigation menu under Screening management, 
a new **File Scan** Tab folder will be created in the right panel.

Click the Browse.. Button to open a window. Then select a file to be uploaded. 
The file will be saved temporarily in the server. 
The user can check the "append timestamp" checkbox to append the current timestamp into the file name. 
If the same file name exists in the server, it will be automatically renamed by adding _v# in the end of the file, 
where # can be 1, 2, 3, etc. 
For example, if the file name is customer_data_file.csv, it will be renamed to customer_data_file_v1.csv. 

Click the Submit Button to upload the file into server. Depending on the size of the file, it may take a couple of minutes to upload.
