Screening Instance (Engine)
============================================

Screening Instance, also called Screening engine is a service that scans text/message(s) against the Screening Instance which 
gives alert or no alert result. Screening Instance manages those Screening instances/engines. 
Currently we only support one physical index and one Screening engine at a time which also means that at any time, 
there is only one Screening engine running, 
using the index that was last built (see Build-Index below). The last built index will override the previous one.

Clicking the **Screening Instance** in the left navigation menu under Screening management will make 
a new **Screening Instance** Tab folder be created in the right panel. 
There are 3 sub-Tab folders: :ref:`screen-instance-search`, :ref:`screen-instance-search-result` and :ref:`screen-instance-new`.

  This is a Sanction List search :ref:`list-listentry-search` panel, allowing the user to select the sanction list entries to be included 
  in this screening instance. It is pre-populated with the data in the Configuration Data field.

  Set search criteria; then clicking the Find Button will get a list of sanction list entries that meet the search criteria. 
  Those sanction list entries will be indexed and used by this screening instance to scan customer data and/or payment transaction.

  * Clicking the **Finish** button will save the configuration into the Configuration Data field.

* **Build Index** -- Click this button to build search index using the sanction list set in the previous step.
    
    .. note:: 
    
       Search index must be re-built in order to affect the configuration data changes. 
       This is a very important step. Screening Instance uses search index to scan against customer data or transaction messages.
