.. _admin-users:

Users
======

The Users function manages the users in the system. There is only one user, **admin**, who is created when the system is first initiated.

Users are the individual members of the organization who are allowed to log in to the SimpleOFAC to perform their required tasks. 
This includes investigators, compliance officers, administrators, etc. The administrator controls the levels of functionality and 
the data that users can access by assigning them to Groups or by granting roles directly to each user.

Click the **Users** Tab in the left navigation menu under Administration and a new **Users** Tab folder will be created in the right panel. 
There are 3 sub-Tab folders:  :ref:`admin-user-search`, :ref:`admin-user-search-result` and :ref:`admin-user-new`.
