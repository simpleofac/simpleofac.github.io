=============

SimpleOFAC Suiteâ„¢ compliance software is a pure-Java server-side web application. 
It runs on any platform (Windows, Unix, Linux ) and supports most Relational Databases (HSQLDB, Oracle, MYSQL, Microsoft SQL).


Requirement
--------------

In order to install SimpleOFAC Suite, you'll need a server environment that meets the following requirements:

* A servlet engine with at least JSP 1.2 and Servlet 2.4 support.
* JDK 1.6.x or later.
* A supported database with a JDBC 2.0 compliant driver.

We bundle with Apache Tomcat 6.0.35 and HSQL DB 2.2.8 with the distributed zip/gz file.

Installation
--------------

Please follow the steps below to deploy the application ::

    1. un-pack the zip/gz file in a folder, eg. app

    2. open a command console, set the JRE HOME if JRE HOME is not set yet
     for example, in window: 
         set JRE_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_20
     in unix/linux:
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-sun

    3. go to the unpacked folder (eg.app). 
     then cd to tomcat bin folder, run the startup command
     cd freetrial\tomcat6\bin

     startup.bat (window)
     ./startup.sh (unix/linux)

    4. you should be ready to go. 

     open a broswer (ie,firefox,chrome)
     http://servername:8080/simpleofac/Main.html

     change the server name with your server name or ip address,
      or localhost if it is in the same machine
     eg. http://localhost:8080/simpleofac/Main.html
