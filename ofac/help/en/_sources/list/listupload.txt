Upload Sanction List
============================================

This function allows users to load large volumes of data into List Management. 

The following lists are supported and a new plugin can easily be added to support a new list: 
BIS-DPL, BIS-UNVENRIFIED, CIA WORLD LEADER, EU, HUD-LDP, NS-PLC, OCC UNAUTHORIZED BANK LIST, OFAC SDN, OFSI ENTITY, 
OFSI INDIVIDUAL, STATE-DEBAR, and UK-HM.

Click the **Upload List** in the left navigation menu under List management and a new **Upload List** Tab folder will be created 
in the right panel.

Click the Browse.. Button to open a window. Then select a file to be uploaded. 
The file will be saved temporarily in the server.
The user can check the "append timestamp" checkbox to append the current timestamp into the file name.

If the same file name exists in the server, it will be automatically renamed by adding _v# in the end of the file, 
(where # can be 1, 2, 3, etc). 
For example, if the file name is customer_data_file.csv, it will be renamed to customer_data_file_v1.csv. 



Click the Submit Button to upload the file into server. Depending on the size of the file, it may take a couple of minutes to upload.
