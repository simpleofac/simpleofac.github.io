Report
=============

SimpleEPT™ uses the popular Java reporting library **JasperReports**. 

SimpleEPT™ has the following built-in reports:
#. Compliance list alert detail report (WL alert).
#. WL alert by Status.
#. WL alert by Assigned To.
#. WL alert by Organization Unit.
#. WL alert by Hit Origin.
#. SQL Query report.  
#. US regulatory reports, such as CTR, SAR, and EFile.

.. note:: 
   
   SQL query type report will run the SQLscript and export the result as an Excel or PDF file. 
   It requires some knowledge on our internal tables.

Click the **Reports** in the left navigation menu under Report Admin and 
a new **Reports** Tab folder will be created in the right panel. 
There are 3 sub-Tab folders: :ref:`report-search`, :ref:`report-search-result` and :ref:`report-new`.
