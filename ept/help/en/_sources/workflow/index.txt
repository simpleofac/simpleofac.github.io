Workflow
============================================


Each access person pre-clearance/broker-confirm transaction has a status code; for example: Pass, Failed, Approved, Denied, etc. 
Users can define any status code as needed via Resources->dropdown :ref:`res-dropdown` .

Workflow rules define actions that the current alert can perform. Each action rule has an action code, action name, from status, to status, 
permission key, etc. These are the rules to move alerts from one status to another. It can be very simple, 
from New to Approved. It also can be more complicated, like add comments, add documents, escalate to compliance officer, etc. 
It is easily configurable to suit your business needs without vendor involvement.
