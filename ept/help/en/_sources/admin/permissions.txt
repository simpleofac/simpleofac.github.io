      For permission on workflow actions, use the following name convention::
   
         workflow name + .action. + status name + action name.
         For example, wla.action.new.assigntoperson is a permission for watch list alert(wla) workflow. 
         It allows the user to assign the alert to a Person when the alert is at the New status.
