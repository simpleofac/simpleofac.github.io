Administration
============================================


SimpleEPT has a flexible security system which allows you to configure who can access 
and what they can do/see within the system. It supports the concepts of users, groups, permissions, roles, 
and organization units.

a) **Users** are the individual members of the organization who are allowed to log in to the SimpleEPT 
   to perform their required tasks. Those include investigators, compliance officers, administrators etc. 
   The administrator controls the levels of functionality and the data that users can access by
   assigning them to Groups or by granting roles directly to each user.
   
b) **Groups** are collections of users. Users that carry out common functions are grouped together in order that 
   roles (and therefore permissions) can be granted to the group as a whole instead of to each individual user. 
   This is possible as all members of the group inherit the security permissions that are assigned to users through 
   group roles. You can add as many users as you want to a particular group.
   
c) **Permissions** govern access to functions within the system including the menu items and workflow actions. 
   Permissions provide access to functional areas of the SimpleEPT. It combines with Organization Units
   to govern access to the data.
   
d) **Roles** are collections of one or more permissions. A role determines the functionality a user can access 
   in the system. The administrator may grant several roles to users or to user groups. An administrator defines 
   and maintains the security roles within the system and the permissions associated with each role. A role may be 
   thought of as a job function that one of the users of the system may use. For example, Alert Investigator,
   Supervisor, List administrator, and so on. When role is assigned to users or groups, it must also specify an 
   Organizational Unit. A User can have a role in Organization Unit X and a role B in Organization Unit Y.

e) **Organization Units** are lines of business within the organization.  
   Entities within the SimpleEPT must be assigned to a particular Organization Unit. 
   This enables the data to be split into different business areas that can be acted upon by specific users and groups 
   of users, who also have roles that are assigned to specific Organization Units.
   
SimpleEPT uses its internal tables for authentication and authorization. It also can integrate with 
LDAP for authentication. If internal tables are used for authentication, system administrator can configure 
the password strength rules (via regular expression), password expire interval, maximum allowed failed login count, etc.
