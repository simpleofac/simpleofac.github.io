.. _admin-groups:

Groups
======

Groups are collections of users. Users that carry out common functions are grouped together in order that roles 
(and therefore permissions) can be granted to the group as a whole instead of to each individual user. This is possible 
as all members of the group inherit the security permissions that are assigned to users through group roles. 
You can add as many users as you want to a particular group.

Click the **Groups** in the left navigation menu under Administration, a new **Groups** Tab folder will be created in the right panel. 
There are 3 sub-Tab folders:  :ref:`admin-group-search`, :ref:`admin-group-search-result` and :ref:`admin-group-new`.
