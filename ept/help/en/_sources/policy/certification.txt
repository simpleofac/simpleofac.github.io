Certification
============================================

There are several possible certifications that you or your firm may hold: Annual Certificate of Holdings, Annual
Certificate of Broker accounts, Quarterly Certificate of Transactions, and custom certifications that are specific to your
firmâ€™s needs. The compliance officer or system admin can set up certification and assign access to users or groups. 
This certification can be used in the rule builder. The access person must submit the required certifications; 
otherwise their transaction(s) will be failed or denied.   

Click the **Certification** in the left navigation menu 
under Firm Policy and a new Certification Tab folder will be created in the right panel. 
There are 3 sub-Tab folders: :ref:`policy-certification-search`, :ref:`policy-certification-search-result` and :ref:`policy-certification-new`.
