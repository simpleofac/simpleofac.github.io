Detection Builder
============================================

The Detection Builder Module creates detection models, which include queries and rules. 
The system admin and compliance officer can create separate model(s) for different Org units. 
An access person's transactions will run against those rules within the detection model(s) within the same org units.  

.. note:: 

   All the data in the SimpleEPT are assigned to an Organization Unit. Users are authorized by combining the Organization
   Unit code with permission and roles. Users may be able to have full access to transaction in Organization Unit A, but have no access 
   or limited access to the transaction in Organization Unit B. (Please see User security section :ref:`admin-index` for details).
